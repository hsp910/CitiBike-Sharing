## [View Story on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harsh.patel6786/viz/CitibikeChallenge_16393434068320/CitibikeAnalysis)

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help others decide if it is worth investing into bike sharing businesses like CitiBike has in other major cities. To help with this process we are using the data CitiBike posts online to decide the viability and profitability of a bike sharing program, and we are using the same data to help determine the target audience from various factors, primarily gender and age. The data we are specifically looking at is CitiBike's provided data for August of 2019 within New York City. From this data we are to clean it and use visualizations help illustrate as many trends and opportunities as possible for other cities.
